# portfolio_website
the project can be run by downloading it, and running it on liveserver in vscode for example. 


The domain link "https://janerikmerio123.github.io/portfolio_website" doesn't unfornutately work due to errors in npm, as some of the packeges didn't find 'funding' and due to that the deployment on pages.github did not succeed.
